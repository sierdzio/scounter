  Scounter readme file

\brief Scounter is a small app that will tell you how much time is left until
(or since) a given date and time

The application can be compiled for any desktop or mobile platform that Qt
supports (Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.).

How it works: simple. Specify the date and (optionally) time, tap the button,
and Scounter will tell you how many weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds are
between now and then. Additionally, there are some special effects, like
particles flying in the background, etc. Yay! :P

It is developed mostly for fun and personal use and is simple enough that it can
serve as a code learning project.

scounter requires at least Qt 5.3.0.

A moderatly up-to-date Android build can be found at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3581612/scounter.apk
